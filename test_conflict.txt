This is a sample file to test merge conflict highlighting.

Here's some normal text that both branches agree on.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the current branch content.
It has some specific changes that were made locally.
We want to keep this version because it's better.
=======
This is the incoming branch content.
It contains different changes from the remote.
This version has its own improvements too.
>>>>>>> feature-branch

And here's some more text after the conflict.

Another section with potential conflicts:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Current implementation:
- Uses new API
- Has better error handling
- Includes unit tests
=======
Incoming implementation:
- Uses legacy API
- Basic error handling
- Missing some tests
>>>>>>> feature-branch

End of test file.
